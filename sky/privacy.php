				<p>
					This Privacy Policy covers what we do with any personal information you may submit, as well as any other information that we may gather when you access our
					website.
				</p>
				<p>

					Please note that our policies and procedures apply only to this website owned by us and not to websites maintained by other companies or to any website to
					which we may link or businesses with which we may share information.
				</p>
				<p>

					Personal information is any information that you provide to us that identifies you, personally, or that can be associated with you. Examples of personal
					information that will be collected on our site include your name, your address, your e-mail address, your phone number.
				</p>
				<p>

					We collect and use personal information in order to respond to your requests for services offered through our website and those of our business partners.
					We also collect personal and other information in order to make you aware of products and/or services that are likely to be of interest to you.
				</p>
				<p>

					We collect and maintain the information you provide to us whenever you visit our website(s), such as:
				</p>
				<ul type="disc">
					<li>
						Any information you provide to us when you request a quote, more information, or a service. This includes your contact information, your name, and
						additional information such as the amount of your current unsecured debt.
					</li>
					<li>
						Information, such as your e-mail address, that you provide to us when you register to receive communications from us or when you communicate with us,
						or otherwise correspond with us.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					We also collect other, non-personal information, which is broadly defined as any information that is not and cannot be directly associated with you. An
					example of this type of non-personal information would be your state of residence.

					We use the personal information you supply to us, or that you authorize us to obtain, to provide to you the service(s) or product(s) that you request. We
					may also use your personal and other information to enhance your experience on our website(s) by displaying content based on your preferences and/or to
					send information to you about additional products or services in which you may be interested.
				</p>
				<p>

					If you submit a request for information or a quote, we will share the personal and other information you supply (such as your name, email, zip code, debt
					amounts etc.) with those product and service providers that have agreed to participate in our network. Generally, these are debt relief solution providers
					who are prohibited from using the information we provide to them for any other purpose, including using your information for other, unrelated marketing
					purposes.
				</p>
				<p>

					By submitting your request you are consenting to being contacted by us or by our business partners through any means, based on the information you provide
					to us, even if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List administered by the Federal Trade Commission, any state Do Not Call List or the Do Not
					Call List of any specific institution. If, after you are contacted by that product or service provider, you do not wish to be contacted by that person
					again you must make a specific request to the service provider.
				</p>
				<p>

					We may be required to share your information with law enforcement or government agencies in response to subpoenas, court orders or other forms of legal
					process. We may elect to share information when, in our reasonable judgment, such sharing is necessary or appropriate for the investigation or prevention
					of illegal activities, including actual or suspected fraud, real or potential threats to the physical safety of any person or otherwise as required by law.
				</p>
				<p>

					In addition, if we are merged with, or acquired by, another company the successor company will have access to all of the information collected and
					maintained by us. In such a circumstance, the successor company would continue to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. You will be
					notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you
					may have regarding your personal information.
				</p>
				<p>

					We collect certain types of non-personal information and technical data from each visitor to our website(s). For example, when you click on a banner
					advertisement or text link that is associated with one of our websites, the banner or text placement, along with the time of your visit, your Internet
					Protocol address and other path-related information, is sent to us. Similarly, the page requests you make when you visit our website(s) are stored and used
					by us. We use this information, none of which is or can be personally associated with you, for statistical and analytic purposes, to help us understand
					which page views are most appealing to our customers and to help us improve the likelihood that we will be able to offer you only products or services in
					which you have a genuine interest.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Cookies" are small files that are placed automatically on your computer system when you visit a website. Cookies enable a website to recognize you as a
					return visitor and, by keeping track of your website activity, help us identify which pages to serve to you while reducing the time it takes for those
					pages to load. Cookies enable us to personalize and enrich your experience and are not tied in any way to your personal information. If you do not wish to
					accept cookies or if you wish to remove cookies that remain in your browser following the close of your browser session, you may adjust the settings on
					your web browser to prevent cookies from being placed on your hard drive.
				</p>
				<p>

					The security of your personal information is a very high priority for us and we take a number of steps to safeguard it.
				</p>
				<p>
					We use commercially reasonable physical and technical security measures to protect all personal information in our possession. We cannot, however,
					guarantee or warrant the absolute security of any system or that any information we hold will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.
				</p>
				<p>

					We may retain your information indefinitely although it would only be used within the specifications of this privacy policy. We will retain and use your
					information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Under certain circumstances, Federal and/or
					state law may require us to retain your personal information for different periods of time. Accordingly, we may not be able to delete or otherwise remove
					your personal information from our systems.
				</p>
				<p>

					Yes, you may contact us to do so at anytime to remove or edit your information.
				</p>
				<p>

					You can always elect not to provide personal information to us. If you wish to request that we no longer use your information to provide you services
					contact us at privacy@debtcompanyresearch.com. If you decide, at a later point in time, that you no longer want us to share your personal information with
					our business partners you may notify us either by sending us an e-mail:
					privacy@debtcompanyresearch.com
				</p>
				<p>

					We have a strict "anti-spam" policy. You will not receive e-mails from us unless you submit your e-mail address to us. We do not permit any third-party
					e-mail service to send unsolicited e-mails – "spam" – to any person who has not previously given their permission to receive such communications to that
					third party e-mail service. If you wish to stop receiving future e-mails from a third-party e-mail service, we recommend you follow the opt-out
					instructions included in the e-mail. An "unsubscribe" link should appear within or at the top or bottom of any e-mail you receive.
				</p>
				<p>

					If you submit a testimonial to us, we will ask for your permission to post your testimonial prior to any public use. We will post your name as given to us
					in your testimonial. We may post a photo of you or use a stock photo. Please be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit as a
					testimonial to be posted can be read, collected, or used by the general public, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible
					for the personally identifiable information you choose to include in any testimonial you choose to submit. If at any time you decide to remove your
					testimonial, please contact us via e-mail or postal mail.
				</p>
				<p>

					We do not knowingly collect, use or share personal information about visitors under 18 years of age. If you are under 18 years of age, you can use the
					products and/or services offered on our website(s) only in conjunction with your parents or guardians.
