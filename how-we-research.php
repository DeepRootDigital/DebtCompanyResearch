				<h2>How We Research:</h2>
				<img src="images/tab-divider.png">
				<p>Our mission is to suggest reliable, honest, straightforward talking companies to people who seek trustworthy advice and suggestions on how to get out of debt. We use a combination of industry experience and contacts, online research, industry tradegroups, and face to face meetings to determine which companies we suggest.</p>
				<p>We believe that all the extra legwork is critical for knowing which companies are about helping people and not just their bottom line.</p>
				<p>And once a company makes the cut, we maintain constant communication with them. Customer service is critical to any debt relief process and we want to ensure that they take care of people once they are in the program. After all most programs last many months and years so you deserve to have clear communication with the company you are working with.</p>
				<p>When problems come up, we often can help resolve them if it is a communication issue between you and the company we suggested to you.</p>
