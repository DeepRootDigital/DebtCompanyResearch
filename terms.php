					The Agreement describes the terms and conditions applicable to your use of the Debt Company Research (DCR) Website. These terms may be updated by DCR from
					time to time without notice to you.

					1. <strong>What We Do.</strong> The DCR Website is a matching service that helps you find companies and counselors to assist you with financial needs. You
					understand and agree that if you submit a request for a service offered through the Website, DCR will share your personal information (such as your full
					name, state of residence, telephone number, email, and debt amount) with Providers in our provider network (referred to individually as “Provider” and
					collectively as “Providers”) to process and fulfill your request about their services.
				</p>
				<p>
					We carefully screen our providers and offer the opportunity to be on our site only to those we believe are trustworthy and reputable. Please understand the
					providers shown on this site are paying clients of ours. We have a marketing relationship with them and we may be compensated for providing your
					information as a lead or on a per client obtained basis. You acknowledge that DCR is not a party to any agreement that you may make with the Provider, and
					that the Provider is solely responsible for its services to you. You further acknowledge that DCR is not acting as your agent or broker and is not
					recommending any particular product or Provider to you. We offer our opinion and our research. The opinions about companies profiled on the DCR website are
					ours and we make no warranties, representations, or guarantees regarding the products or services provided by the 3rd party companies on the site. The
					opinions are opinions only and any user should do their own research prior to engaging the services of the companies profiled on DCR. Any compensation DCR
					may receive is paid by the individual Provider for services rendered by DCR to that particular Provider on a per lead, per sale or per phone contact basis.
					DCR does not charge you a fee to use the DCR Website. You understand that DCR does not endorse, warrant, or guarantee the products or services of any the
					Providers. We have done research on the companies mentioned on the site and have based our opinions on that research. You agree that DCR shall not be
					liable for any damages or costs of any type which arise out of or in connection with your use of the Provider’s service.
				</p>

					By submitting your contact request, you are consenting to be contacted by the Provider either by telephone, email or mail based on the information you have
					provided to us, even if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List administered by the Federal Trade Commission, any state equivalent Do Not Call
					List, or the Do Not Call List of an internal company. You understand that the Provider may maintain the information you submitted to DCR whether you elect
					to use their services or not. In the event you no longer want to receive communications from a Provider, you agree to notify the Provider directly. You
					also give DCR permission to send you periodic updates on behalf of the Provider which may be of interest to you.
