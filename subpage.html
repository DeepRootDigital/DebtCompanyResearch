							<h2>Our Results:</h2>

							<p>
								Our job is to point you in the right direction, to steer you away from shady companies. If you believe the company we suggest to you is honest, law abiding, and reputable then we've done our job.
							</p>
							<p>
								Through various websites and companies our team has been a part of, we've helped well over 120,000 with suggestions for reliable debt solutions. Many of those people have successfully gone on to be debt free. Some of them benefitted greatly from the free consultation which provided invaluable advice as to what their options were. Others who didn't qualify were provided a referral to a different solution which was better suited for their individual situation.
							</p>
							<p>
								The point is that the more you know, the easier and smoother your journey to becoming debt free will be.
								There are solutions for you out there and we sleep great at night knowing we've helped guide so many people in the right direction. How can we help you?

								<h4>&#183; About Our Process &#183;</h4>
							</div>
							<p>We are very selective about the companies we suggest. Yes, we do REAL research and we even personally meet most of the companies in person before they make the cut. We approach the carefully selected firms and develop marketing relationships with them. 
								Yes, they do pay us referral fees (our families need to eat too :) and we have no problem admitting that because we sleep great at night knowing we are suggesting only the best most honest companies to you.</p>
