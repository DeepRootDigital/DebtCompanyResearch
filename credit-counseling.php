				<h2>Credit Counseling:</h2>

				<h4>What is credit counseling?</h4>
				<p>A credit counseling program helps you pay back the full amount that you owe but makes it much easier by consolidating your payments, reducing your interest rates, and reducing or eliminating fees that creditors often pile onto late payments.</p>
				<h4>What does non-profit credit counseling mean?</h4>
				<p>Most credit counseling companies are designated as non-profit by the US government (the IRS specifically). Non-profit does not mean their services are totally free but it does mean they are heavily regulated and there are strict limits on what they can charge for their services. However, they do often provide lots of great information and free initial counseling sessions to help you determine the best way for you to get out of debt.</p>
				<h4>Why not just do debt settlement?</h4>
				<p>For many people debt settlement is the best option as it can do more to lessen your debt burden and lower your payments however, unlike debt settlement, credit counseling agencies are more creditor friendly. As a result, you typically do not have as much damage to your credit score and you end up paying back everything you owe which is important to some people who feel that's their moral obligation.</p>
				<h4>Who qualifies?</h4>
				<p>It really depends on your specific situation and will require you speak with a counselor to determine if you qualify. However, generally people with as little as a few thousand dollars in credit card debt can qualify and certain companies only are able to assist people in certain states.
