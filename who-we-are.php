				<p>Thanks for visiting DebtCompanyResearch.com! This site was started by us to help people navigate the incredibly confusing and sometimes overwhelming choices one has when trying to find debt relief. So many companies, so many different names for solutions...</p>
				<p>Debt consolidation, debt settlement, debt management, debt negotiation, credit counseling, consolidation loan, etc...etc...</p>
				<p>On top of all the naming confusion, you are faced with pages and pages of companies all trying to help you but none of them are household names you recognize so how do you choose? On top of all the naming confusion, you are faced with pages and pages of companies all trying to help you but none of them are household names you recognize so how do you choose?</p>
				<p>That's where we think we can help!</p>
				<p>We are a small team of people made up of industry experts, customer service, &amp; website management. Our #1 goal is to research companies and make suggestions to you based on that research.</p>
				<p>We are VERY selective about who we suggest. Only companies we'd recommend to our own friends and families make the cut.</p>
				<p>Marco - During that time he has worked with lots of different companies. He brings us the industry knowledge that only an insider has. His goal is to seek out only the best, most reputable companies to ensure visitors to this site get the straightforward reliable advice they need.</p>
				<p>Nicole - Nicole is our website guru. She's the one who works hard to try and get the website found so we can help as many people as possible. She wears a variety of hats and under her direction, things run smoothly day in and day out. Nicole's busy schedule doesn't end at the office as she has a house full of kids to come home to at the end of each day.</p>
				<p>Bob - Bob is the researcher. He works behind the scenes digging through companies, new and old to see who is worthy of our short list. It's a challenge to keep up as some companies often come and go trying to stay one step ahead of the regulators by using business models that are no longer allowed under Federal laws. He sniffs out the good guys and makes sure they live up to our high expectations.</p>
				<p>Ben - Ben does all the important work that every business needs done. As the manager of the daily operations, he makes sure our bills are paid and our office is in order. His efficiency and strict attention to detail allows the rest of us to focus on providing the best service for you that we can.</p>
