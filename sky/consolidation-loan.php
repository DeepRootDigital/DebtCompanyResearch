				<h2>Consolidation Loan:</h2>
				<img src="images/tab-divider.png">
				<h4>Who will give me a loan?</h4>
				<p>It is hard to qualify for a consolidation loan. Most banks and loan companies will not risk giving money to someone who already has lots of debt they are looking to consolidate. It's too risky. Typically the only way around this is if you own something of value you can put up as collateral. If you default on the loan, they will own that collateral.</p>
				<h4>What is collateral?</h4>
				<p>The most common form of collateral is a home you own without a high mortgage balance. In that case you can refinance your mortgage and pull money out which you can then use to pay off any high interest credit card balances.</p>
				<h4>Since I can't get a loan, what should I do?</h4>
				<p>If your debt is not manageable given your income level and you see very little way you will ever be able to pay down that debt over time on your own, you may want to request a free consultation with a debt settlement or credit counseling company. The more you learn about your options, the easier and safer the entire process will be.</p>
