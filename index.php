						<h3>Frustrated? Confused?</h3>
						<p>So many companies say they can help you get out of debt but let's face it, it's unlikely you've heard of any of them before.</p>
						<h3>Who can you trust?</h3>
						<p>Our team has been involved in the debt relief business for years. We've witnessed first-hand people's frustrations signing up with companies

							<p>When you complete the simple 3 step form above we determine if you are a candidate for one of our companies. Certain companies only operate in certain states and with particular debt amounts which is why we ask the questions.</p>
							<p>Once a match is made, we provide you with information about the company. You can contact them or they will contact you to provide a free consultation.</p>
							<p>The purpose of the consultation is to learn more about the details of your financial situation so they can be sure you could benefit from their program. If not, they will likely provide you with advice about your options and may even have another suggestion for you.</p>
							<p>Every financial situation is unique, the goal is to find you the right solution for you!</p>

							<p>The debt relief industry for many years was lightly regulated which resulted in hundreds of debt relief companies that were more concerned about their fees than getting their clients out of debt. It was the Wild West!</p>
							<p>Many of those companies have been regulated out of business but where there's money to be made there will always be new fly by night companies that pop up.</p>
							<p>Our goal is to steer you out of harm's way.</p>
							<p>You want to consider companies that have been in business for at least 5-7 years, provide honest advice, comply with all the government rules and regulations, don't engage in high pressure sales pitches, and offer excellent customer service after you've become a client.</p>
							<p>In short, you want to get out of debt safely in the shortest time possible - we know the companies that can get you there.</p>
