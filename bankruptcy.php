				<h4>Who can just file bankruptcy?</h4>
				<p>Anyone can file bankruptcy to try and eliminate your debts however as few years ago the laws became much tougher. Filing bankruptcy used to be a rather uncomplicated process but now it requires more court oversight and approval before your debts are eliminated. It takes time and has serious consequences on your credit score and your personal financial standing. All types of applications for everything from jobs to home rental leases to car loans ask if you've ever filed bankruptcy. If you have to answer "yes" the consequences can be extremely damaging and difficult.</p>
				<h4>Is it fast?</h4>
				<p>No. The new laws have made bankruptcy a much more involved process that often includes entering a credit counseling program.</p>
				<h4>Do I need a lawyer?</h4>
				<p>Like any legal situation you can go to the courthouse and file papers on your own but it can be a confusing and time consuming process which is why people often hire bankruptcy attorneys to assist them.</p>
